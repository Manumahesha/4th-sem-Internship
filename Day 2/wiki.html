    <p>Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a 1991 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, who co-wrote the script with William Wisher. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick (pictured), and Edward Furlong, it is the sequel to The Terminator (1984). In the film, Skynet, a malevolent artificial intelligence, sends a Terminator android (Patrick) back in time to 1995 to kill the young John Connor (Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. The resistance sends back a less-advanced Terminator (Schwarzenegger), reprogrammed to protect Connor. The film had an estimated $94â€“102 million budget, making it the most expensive film made up to that time. Industrial Light & Magic created a computer-generated main character, the first in a blockbuster film. Terminator 2 was the highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide, at $520 million. Critics praised the visual effects, action sequences, and cast, especially Patrick. The film won Saturn, BAFTA, and Academy awards</p>
